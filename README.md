# Pong with Sound

A simple Pong game built in Python with sound effects.  
Play the classic arcade game with a retro feel, including bounce and score sounds.  

## 🎮 Features
- Player vs AI Pong gameplay (AI paddle tracks the ball automatically)  
- Ball bounces realistically off paddles and walls  
- Score tracking for both players  
- Sound effects for collisions and points  
- Automatically generates default sound files if missing (custom `.wav` files can be swapped in)  
- Lightweight and easy to run

2. Install dependencies:

## 🎹 Controls
- Player (Left Paddle):
   - W = Move Up
   - S = Move Down

## 🔊 Sound Files
- The game uses hit_sound.wav and score_sound.wav.
- If they don’t exist, the program will automatically generate simple beep sounds.
